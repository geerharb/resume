Hello,

I've enjoyed my experience working as a TA mostly due to interactions with the students. I honestly thought of myself as an average guy, so I thought everyone had no trouble with physics, but as a TA I actually found many students struggled to understand the concepts in physics. As a TA I took a student centered approach by going above and beyond what a typical TA was required to do. For example I usually gave extra practice problems and feedback to students, and I helped students outside of office hours to study for their exams. By far the most enjoyable part of my TA work was that I tried to motivate students to do better by combining physics with philosophy to leave the students with the feeling that their destiny is in their own hands.

Further, my experience with computational physics has forced me to solve problems in unconventional ways. For instance I once talked with my advisor about identifying atoms in a liquid or solid state within a single molecular dynamics simulation. My advisors idea was to use a single snapshot along with bonding lengths to determine if an atom was in a liquid or solid state. I realized a single snapshot contained lots of noise, so I instead used two snapshots separated in time. The idea was an atom in a solid state doesn't change nearest neighbors very often, while an atom in a liquid state is constantly changing nearest neighbors. The logic for this new metric was relatively easy to implement.

My experience as a TA shows I do want the people around me to succeed in whatever it is they are trying to do, while my computational physics background shows that I do like to solve problems in unconventional ways. This is why I feel I will do well as an engineer at SpaceX.

Thank you for your time,
Billy Geerhart.
