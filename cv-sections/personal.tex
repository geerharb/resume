\personalStatement
{
My two passions are programming and physics. I used my two passions to work on computational projects to earn both a BS and MS degree in physics. My computational physics background has forced me to learn various programming languages and software to get work done. For example I wanted to learn about entanglement via non-linear waves, so I first learned about the Lagrangian applied to continuous systems, I then converted a linear wave into a non-linear wave by enforcing special relativity, and finally I spent a summer to learn CUDA programming to use my GPU to explore the non-linear wave in a timely manner. I enjoy analyzing and solving problems which is why I'm interested in working as an engineer at Orbital ATK.
